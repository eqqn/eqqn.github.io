## Yurevent - 50 Write-up

Points: **50**

Description:
AlpacaCon is one of those conferences where tickets are sold-out in minutes. Hopefully, there might be a way to get a ticket at a reasonable price.

We have a simple ticket sale website, however all tickets are sold out! ( alluding to GreHack tickets this year).

## Getting the ticket

If we try to submit a purchase with one of the pricy Benefactor tickets, the site responds with an error.

If we look into the POST request and response issued with the request the error says `Insufficient funds` (you can see the network activity in Firefox Developer tools).

Parameter data we send with request looks like this:

```
{"total":1500,"tickets":{"0":5},"billing":{"first_name":"eqqn","last_name":"eqqn","email":"grehack@f.tw"}}
```

We can make an educated guess that the ticket quantity is "0" and that type is 5. 

Replaying the request with lower number than 1500 ( ? price?) in this case returns errors. If you don't select any ticket, you get error
`No ticket selected` . 

So when we make ` "tickets":{"1":1} ` the requests passes. 

`{"total":1500,"tickets":{"1":1},"billing":{"first_name":"eqqn","last_name":"eqqn","email":"grehack@f.tw"}}`

### GH19{frontend_validation_is_not_enough}

Thanks to **Le_suisse** for posting the source code of the challenges, so I can make the write-up once the event is over :)

## Connection to Weezevent

Weezevent is a payment service provider used by many events in France. A similar bug was exploited by one security professional to get a ticket to GreHack. You can watch the presentation on the exploit here - it's really entertaining
