# Why should your company do a CTF?

I've been asked to make a CTF style hackathon internally for the engineers. 

The first challenge was modelling the problems after our stack and use cases, making the scenarios seem realistic and having some kind of moral at the end of the day. 

At some point I stopped to think: How to get developers to spend 2-4 hours in a room to bang their heads against odd problems. Seasoned CTF players are well exposed to mind-twisting puzzles, but average developer may not be. 
So my first approach was to make the challenges accessible, within grasp, using skills they already know, like version control and testing.

Second core question was WHY. Why should I waste developers time and pull them from their daily tasks. 

Is this the right way to teach security awareness? Isn't another WebAppSec seminar more beneficial to the organization as a whole?

## Learnings from Incident Response 
The "Eureka" moment was had when I was watching Incident Response course materials. To respond to an incident you need a set of technical skills(forensics, programming, understanding the OS environment, logging, etc), but also problem solving skills.

When a security incident disrupts operations, the first responders, knowingly or not, will be the ones closest to development/operations functions. And whatever they will be facing is not going to be some routine activity that they do day-to-day with clearly defined procedures. So my CTF has now gained new momentum and justification - train the engineers problem solving skills in the face of unexpected.

Out of this, more challenges relating to log analysis and light forensics were born. To give the taste of what it takes to resolve a problem you are facing for the first time, that involves security and integrity of operations.

## Summary
So to summarize, putting your developers under a clock to resolve some imaginary problems they haven't encountered before, but keeping it within their sphere of knowledge is the right way to go. The new synapses to spring from such work will help the company in the long run, as long as you give the engineers the right set of problems and a little incentive ( what's a CTF without a bit of prizes and recognition/bragging rights :p )
