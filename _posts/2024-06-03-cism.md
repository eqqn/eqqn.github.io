## CISM

Working to understand policies and regulations, pre-sales topics and being one-man show for a large organization in terms of security I was looking to gain competence 
or validate it on a higher and more widely recognized manner.

Something you don't get out of university course - business interactions with security, security reporting lines.

Something you don't get out of penetration testing or ethical hacking training. Yes, you are demonstrating business impact and writing the reports, but thats where similarities end.
Demonstrating business impact is only a fraction of successful security work inside organization at higher levels, you also have to present business cases, feasability and other things.

As someone who started as a security engineer, I was frustrated about change management, certain gatekeeping or inaction and general dislike for compliance ( common stance for us cyberpunks).
The training proposes models that are oriented to business objectives, with security as an enabler, not the blocker, gatekeeper, control-everything, cover everything attitude. 
I still reserve right to be frustrated over aforementioned, but I learned to advocate better for the business interests, understand the responsibilities of compliance and legal
and interact with these parts of organization better.

Manager may not necessarily mean managing people. It's about owning a topic and being competent about it. 

### Thoughts on the material

I relied only on CISM QAE (Questions, Answers, Explanations) Database from ISACA. The materials are divided into 4 categories:
* Information Security Governance
* Information Security Risk Management 
* Information Security Program 
* Incident Management

While I would like to learn from a book or other structured material, instead of reverse engineering and "drilling" correct way to respond, it is enough to pass the test if you have worked in the domain.
  
Each of the categories is further divided into specific subjects, with some overlap in the areas. By going through the questions I maintained ~70% correct responses, and wrong responses made me reconsider the question or how it is phrased. This is where engineering biases were a bit counterproductive and led to frustration. Sometimes the questions lack context on purpose, or insinuate certain facts only after the answer is selected. Sometimes there is play on English words, which is not obvious : material uses "impact" 96% of the time, but then spices it up with "criticality" and "magnitude" when referring to the same concepts just to mess with you. "users" can mean end users, corporate users, internal users, and is variable. 
Luckily most of these problems were not so prominent during exam. 

### CEO MINDSET

One thing that is perhaps more commonly taught in MBA than cybersecurity, is the risk management. CISM teaches that all the "higher imperatives" such as Legislation or Compliance are to be treated like any other type of risk. If the cost of achieving compliance is higher than the possible fine, or is weakly enforced, it is rational to take the risk. 


### The exam

For the record I've done some proctored exams beforehand via Pearson Vue (Azure certs) and survived OSCP proctored test, but I was not prepared for PSI testing. I have made sure to read the exam registration guide, proctor guide, video guide but have not taken the tutorial because my test was on Monday morning, and tutorial is open only 2 days before test, but not 150 minutes before the test(????). 

This led me to panicked scrambling when I discovered that infact the "recommended" browser, Chrome, is actually mandatory, because there is a special extension and that "system compatibility test" does not suffice to be ready for the exam. With official materials outdated, support articles irrelevant and incomplete. I also had to exercise caution while under pressure, not to download anything malicious off a poisoned search.
I was up and running with freshly downloaded chrome and the chrome extension needed to read the PSI link that downloads .exe file. This, naturally was not included in the exam guide, but only aluded as "Secure Browser" in bold, with no link whatsoever. This is also a recurring problem with the proctor, from the amount of search results and discussions in this topic.

The exam itself went fluently, and I completed it in a little over 2 hours with 1 break. The questions were different from the QAE, but posed in the same way and mostly from the concepts covered in the QAE.






Another reason why the CISM or CISSP is well regarded - hiring managers can effectively outsource credential verification to ISACA/ISC , as one needs to prove their 5-year industry experience to the panel.


### Can a shift from engineering to mgmt be done?

There was a certain "guilt" when I was meddling in matters like legal, strategy, policy and spending time away from my DevOps team. But with CISM training I became more cognizant of how these areas relate to security. It's easy to look at something
and say " it's not an engineering problem".

Bias always exist - where engineers see concrete controls and tools, the ISM will see more abstract means like "data protection" and "controls", non-technical means as well.
