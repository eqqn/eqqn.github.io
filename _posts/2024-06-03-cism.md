## CISM

Working to understand policies and regulations, working on pre-sales topics and being one-man show for a large organization in terms of security I was looking to gain competence 
or validate it on a higher and more widely recognized manner.

Something you don't get out of university course - business interactions with security, security reporting lines.

Something you don't get out of penetration testing or ethical hacking training. Yes, you are demonstrating business impact and writing the reports, but thats where similarities end.
Demonstrating business impact is only a quarter of successful security work inside organization at higher levels, you also have to present business cases, feasability and other things.

As someone who started as a security engineer, I was frustrated about change management, certain gatekeeping or inaction and general dislike for compliance ( common stance for us cyberpunks).
The training proposes models that are oriented to business objectives, with security as an enabler, not the blocker, gatekeeper, control-everything, cover everything attitude. 
I still reserve right to be frustrated over aforementioned, but I learned to advocate better for the business interests, understand the responsibilities of compliance and legal
and interact with these parts of organization better.

Manager may not necessarily mean managing people. It's about owning a topic and being competent about it. 


what the training does not say:
It is stated multiple times that SR mgmt is *accountable* for any consequences, but ISM is *responsible* for security policy, and asset owners are ultimately responsible for doing the things ISM recommends them.
What happens sometimes, is because sr mgmt is accountable, proccess approvers may withhold their approval. despite them potentially having less understanding of the issue at hand than the ISM. 
Compliance approval.
