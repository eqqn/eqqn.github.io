Ever wondered what it is like to work in a high tech manufacturing company?

Recently I joined a manufacturing machine company xyz, with assembly line not unlike here - ( titans of CNC video).

We make all kinds of **very expensive** CNC, EDM and other machines for customers globally in all kinds of industries - automotive, watchmaking, luxury goods, aerospace, IT, military. 

The structure of a machine. In very general terms.

### So what about the security?

Cloud, Transformation, Manufacturing 4.0 

### What of the threats?

Do penetration testers test industrial networks regularly? How much of the machines are "do not touch"? Considering the cost of equipment, scrap, downtime, might be logical to exclude those targets...
