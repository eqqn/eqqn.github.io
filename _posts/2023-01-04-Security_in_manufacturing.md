## Introduction

Ever wondered what it is like to work in a high tech manufacturing company? Earlier in 2022 I was looking for career change and jumped on the opportunity to work for a high precision Swiss ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ machine manufacturing company.

They make all kinds of **very expensive** CNC, EDM and other machines for customers globally in all kinds of industries - automotive, watchmaking, luxury goods, aerospace, IT, military. If you think about 


P.S.: I will avoid naming the company I work for, so images and examples will be rather general, but accurately represent the industry (although shouldn't be hard to guess,find. Don't take it as a challenge). Opinions my own and so on.

We have an assembly line not unlike in the video above, and industrial secrecy is important (no photos allowed on the shop floor).

## What's inside a machine?

As you can probably guess, a 5 axis CNC machine will contain a lot of electromechanical parts. 
PLCs, motors, connection cables, and buses for industrial protocols.

From security point of view, it makes sense that they are isolated and sit behind an internal switch. To control this

### So what about the security?

Cloud, Transformation, Manufacturing 4.0 

### What of the threats?

Do penetration testers test industrial networks regularly? How much of the machines are "do not touch"? Considering the cost of equipment, scrap, downtime, might be logical to exclude those targets...
